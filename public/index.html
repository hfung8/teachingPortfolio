              When I first learned to code at a web development bootcamp in 2017, it felt like a watershed moment. Throughout college I had struggled to combine my interests in one specific field, and with computer science I found my footing. In my experience, computer science can be made suitable to students of all ages, and it's uniquely teachable to kids. Learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to develop fully functional websites with databases meant that the work I completed immediately served a purpose, and my design abilities made that work more relatable to users.  Being able to creatively solve problems drew me to coding, and learning to teach the skill solidified my enthusiasm for the discipline. 
              <br>
              <br>Now, five years later, I am finishing my MSEd in Computer Science at Hunter College. Computer Science is the fastest growing subject in schools, and is now taught very widely. It's an equal opportunity subject, opening doors for some and providing entertainment and joy to others, regardless of socioeconomics. Exposing students to Computer Science from a young age helps embed a logical way of thinking, a specific system that builds and holds benefits for a lifetime of working with technology. 
              <br>
              <br>Computer Science teaches students the valuable skills of problem-solving, logical thinking, and attention to detail. Computer Science also teaches students perseverance, and the promise that they will reap the rewards from their hard work. It is a privilege to challenge students' growth and be part of their successes.
