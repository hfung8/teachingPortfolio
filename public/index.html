              Computer Science is a unique subject, which from my experience is suitable to many students of all ages. I learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to develop fully functional websites that have a database as well, this was before I decided to focus on teaching as my choice of a career. In those days, I enjoyed coding because of its problem-solving aspect and, I was able to be creative. Developing those two skills were what drew me to Computer Science, however, teaching is what solidified my skills the most. I enjoyed helping others in the coding bootcamp, which I was in and my skills as a developer grew from those experiences.
              <br>
              <br>I am finishing my MSed in Computer Science at Hunter College. Computer Science as a subject has grown so much and there is always a discussion of inclusion in its community. In my opinion, coding should be taught to as many students as is possible. It can open doors for some and provide entertainment and joy to others. Exposing students Computer Science has a lot of benefits, which is why it is a subject that is so universal.
              <br>
              <br>The ability to problem-solve and to build upon previous knowledge, are what students will learn in Computer Science. These are skills that are important in life. Computer Science also teaches students to stick with it, and then they will reap the rewards from their hard work. I feel that these are important skills for future students to learn.
